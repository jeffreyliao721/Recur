For this project, we will be building on top of the tab-harrypotter-practice project. Make sure you are working on your `<name>_week2_branch` branch!

## Students Button
First, add a "Students" button in HouseViewController. Mock: https://invis.io/AEMTGJXHTS4#/307203874_harrypotter-Tableview-1

Create a new view controller called `StudentsViewController`. When the Students button is pressed, present an instance of StudentsViewController.  
Embed this inside a `UINavigationController`.  
Make the left bar button item of the navigation bar say Exit. When it is tapped, dismiss this view controller.

## Students Page
Now, let's add content to our Students Page Mock: https://invis.io/AEMTGJXHTS4#/307203873_harrypotter-Tableview-2

Inside StudentsViewController, make an array of String called students, and populate them with names. You can use this list:   

*Gryffindor:*  
["Harry Potter", "Ron Weasley", "Hermione Granger", "Katie Bell", "Angelina Johnson", "Fred Weasley", "George Weasley", "Oliver Wood"]   

*Ravenclaws:*  
["Sue Li", "Padma Patil", "Lisa Turpin", "Cho Chang", "Eddie Carmichael", "Roger Davies", "Penelope Clearwater"]   

*Hufflepuffs:*  
["Susan Bones", "Justin Finch-Fletchley", "Megan Jones", "Cedric Diggory"]  

*Slytherins:*   
["Vincent Crabbe", "Gregory Goyle", "Daphne Greengrass", "Draco Malfoy", "Pansy Parkinson", "Adrian Pucey"]   

And that's it for now!
