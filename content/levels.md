# Levels

There are 6 levels here at Buildschool. Everyone starts at Level Zero and will be placed into a stable level once all of the coursework has been completed. To advance into any level, you must complete a technical assessment (See below for details!).

## Level Zero
Everyone starts at this level. You can skip from this level to any of the next levels once you have completed all of your iOS Coursework with an average grade of greater than 90. 

## Level One
At this level, you have completed all coursework with an average grade of 90 or higher. You are a consistent participant of the product development cycle with regular attendance and concise updates during standups. You raise questions and ask for help when stuck and respond to any feedback provided during code reviews.

*Core iOS Competencies:*  
UIKit (UILabel / UIButton / UIView / UITableView / UINavigation)  
Code follows style guidelines

*Engineering Skills*  
Git / Github / Pull Requests:  
Able to create pull requests with smart titles / descriptions

*Agile Development*  
Working at a subtask level  
Gives concise updates during daily standup  
Responds promptly to code review feedback  
Proactively asks questions and reaches out for help when stuck.

*Algorithms (Level One):*  
ex. Array vs Set vs Dictionary, Basic Linked List

## Level Two
This is the level where you you master most of the core iOS competencies. You should be able to build most basic features in an application. You're also starting to give time estimates for your own tasks and developing a sense of product by filing bugs and raising issues or inconsistencies with the product spec.

*Core iOS Competencies:*  
Delegate Design Pattern  
Autolayout  
Builds pixel perfect screens

*Engineering Skills*  
Notices and raises inconsistencies with product specs  
Files & assigns bugs based on product spec  
Performing code reviews (mostly on a practice level for now)

*Agile Development*  
Works at a task level  
Accurately provide estimates at the subtask level

*Algorithms (Level Two):*  
ex. Queue vs. Stack, Basic Sorting

## Level Three
At this level, you are starting to be a stronger owner of the product. Your code should be following high level design patterns (such as, but not limited to VIPER), and you're able to debug problems using print statements, breakpoints, and the view hierarchy debugger. You should be acting as the owner of a small area of the codebase and providing code reviews for junior developers touching code in your area of expertise.

*Core iOS Competencies:*  
Debugging (print statements, breakpoints, view debugger)  
Making HTTP requests  
VIPER design patterns

*Engineering Skills*  
Performing quality code reviews  
Acts as an owner on an area of the codebase.

*Agile Development*  
Breaks down stories into subtasks  
Provides estimates at the task level

*Algorithms (Level Three):*  
ex. Binary Tree Problems, Recursion, Complex Sorting, Sliding Window

## Level Four
At this level, you are becoming an independent software engineer with deep understanding of the codebase. You are able to build entire stories independently, and break them down into smaller tasks for junior developers if necessary. You are also beginning to participate in recruiting calls for future students.

*Core iOS Competencies:*  
Asynchronous Interactions

*Engineering Skills*  
Participates in recruiting (performing interviews for future candidates)

*Agile Development*  
Provides estimates at the story level  
Breaks down tasks at the story level into subtasks

*Algorithms (Level Four):*  
Dynamic Programming  
Heap

## Level Five
At this level, you are becoming an advanced software engineer that is actively improving the codebase. You are beginning to build simple features on the backend to support your own front end features. You are now able to technically evaluate future students.   

*Core iOS Competencies:*  
At this point, you should have mastered all of the core skills. Additional skills will now vary based on the tasks at hand.

*Engineering Skills*  
Improves the codebase  
Builds on the backend  
Pair programs with junior developers  
Performs technical interviews for new students

*Algorithms (Level Five):*  
Able to solve complex interview questions

** At levels four and five, students can receive a stipend after their 4 month commitment with Buildschool.


# Technical Assessment
In order to graduate into any level, you must pass a technical assessment. The technical assessment will be a 30-45 minute algorithms interview question on the whiteboard. The algorithms will fall under under the difficulty rating of the corresponding level.
